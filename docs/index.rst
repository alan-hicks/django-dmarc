Description
===========

This Django DMARC project aims to ease implementating DMARC
"Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance" and
ongoing monitoring by importing aggregate and feedback reports about messages
that pass and/or fail DMARC evaluation into a more easily digested format.

Perhaps one of the main reasons DMARC is gaining traction amongst
organisations of all sizes is a desire to protect their people, brand and
reputation.
By defining and implementing a DMARC policy, an organization can help combat
phishing, protect users and their reputation.

At beta stage, the application is stable, with most efforts on improving
usability and documentation.

Choosing Django was an easy choice as it offers an easily built import
mechanism and transformation from xml to database through to presentation.

Although it has options for importing either xml or email files, zero
maintenance is achieved by fully automating import of feedback and reports.
